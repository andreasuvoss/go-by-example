# Go by Example
Since I got stuck on my last go project, I wanted to get myself started again, which is why I will try to go through
['Go by Example'](https://gobyexample.com/).

I'll attempt to do at least one session per day to maximize learning, with the end goal of going through my interpreter
and compiler books, and implement those in Go.
